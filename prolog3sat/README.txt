The program should be working correctly. Didn't do any of the extra credit.

The program requires the new scanner.c/h files, because VAR was added as a new reserved word.

functions used:
1. eval-var()
2. eval-clause(), eval-var(), atomic()
3. get-vars(), reverse(), atomic()
4. get-all-vars(), get-vars(), combine(), remove-duplicates(), remove-element()
5. unsat-clauses(), eval-clause()
6.flip-var(), reverseb(), not(), atomic()

Built-in's used: 
not(): negates truth value
atomic(): succeeds if an atom or number, fails if uninitialized or a compound structure
