I think everything works now. My program successfully created all the images except box and line, but I think the .turtle files used were different.

compile the program with "make"
run the program with ./interpreter < (SOURCE FILE.turtle) > (DESTINATION FILE.pgm) 

Included Files:
parser_rcd.c
scanner.c
symtab.c
turtle.c
scanner.h
symtab.h
turtle.h
Makefile
README.txt
